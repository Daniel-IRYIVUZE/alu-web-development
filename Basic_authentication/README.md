# Basic Authentication API Implementation  

## Project Overview  

I have designed and implemented a secure Basic Authentication system for a RESTful API using Python and Flask. This project serves as an educational demonstration of authentication fundamentals while providing production-grade functionality including:  

- User management with secure credential storage  
- Protected API endpoints with proper access controls  
- Comprehensive error handling for authentication failures  
- Standards-compliant Basic Authentication implementation  

## Technical Implementation  

### Core Components  

I have structured the solution into these key components:  

1. **Authentication Base Class**  
   - Implemented in `api/v1/auth/auth.py`  
   - Provides foundational authentication methods  
   - Includes slash-tolerant path matching with wildcard support  

2. **Basic Authentication Handler**  
   - Located in `api/v1/auth/basic_auth.py`  
   - Fully implements RFC 7617 (Basic Authentication Scheme)  
   - Handles Base64 encoding/decoding of credentials  
   - Validates user credentials against stored data  

3. **User Management**  
   - Model defined in `models/user.py`  
   - Secure password storage using hashing  
   - Serialization/deserialization for persistence  

4. **API Endpoints**  
   - Configured in `api/v1/views/index.py`  
   - Demonstrates both protected and public routes  
   - Includes test endpoints for authentication verification  

## Development Standards  

Throughout this implementation, I have maintained:  

- Strict adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines  
- Comprehensive docstring documentation  
- Type hints for all method signatures  
- Proper error handling and status codes  
- Modular, testable architecture  

## Authentication Flow  

The complete authentication process I've implemented follows these steps:  

1. **Request Interception**  
   - All incoming requests pass through authentication middleware  
   - Public routes are whitelisted using excluded_paths  

2. **Header Validation**  
   - Extracts and validates Authorization header  
   - Verifies Basic Authentication format  

3. **Credential Processing**  
   - Base64 decodes credentials  
   - Separates username and password  
   - Handles edge cases (colons in passwords, etc.)  

4. **User Verification**  
   - Queries user database  
   - Validates password against stored hash  
   - Returns appropriate error responses for failures  

## API Documentation  

### Endpoints  

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Authentication Required |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------------------|
| `/api/v1/status` | GET | Service health check | No |
| `/api/v1/unauthorized` | GET | 401 test endpoint | No |
| `/api/v1/forbidden` | GET | 403 test endpoint | No |
| `/api/v1/users` | GET | List all users | Yes |

### Example Usage  

```bash
# Public endpoint
curl "http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status"

# Authenticated request
curl "http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'email:password' | base64)"
```

## Testing Methodology  

I have verified the implementation through:  

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Individual component testing  
   - Edge case validation  

2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Complete authentication flow testing  
   - Error condition simulation  

3. **Manual Verification**  
   - cURL testing for all endpoints  
   - Negative testing with invalid credentials  

## Security Considerations  

While implementing this solution, I have addressed several security aspects:  

- Never storing plaintext passwords  
- Proper HTTP status codes for failures  
- Secure credential transmission  
- Defense against common authentication attacks  

## Future Enhancements  

Planned improvements include:  

- Rate limiting for authentication attempts  
- JWT support as alternative authentication method  
- Additional user management endpoints  
- Comprehensive logging  

## Installation & Deployment  

### Requirements  

- Python 3.7+  
- Flask  
- pycodestyle (for development)  

### Setup  

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
export API_HOST=0.0.0.0
export API_PORT=5000
export AUTH_TYPE=basic_auth  # or 'auth' for base implementation

# Start service
python -m api.v1.app
```
